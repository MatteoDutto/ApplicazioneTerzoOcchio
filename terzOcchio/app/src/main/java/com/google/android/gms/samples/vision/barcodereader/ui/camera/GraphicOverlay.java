 * A view which renders a series of custom graphics to be overlayed on top of an associated preview
 * (i.e., the camera preview).  The creator can add graphics objects, update the objects, and remove

 * idea is that detection items are expressed in terms of a preview size, but need to be scaled up
 * to the full view size, and also mirrored in the case of the front-facing camera.<p>
